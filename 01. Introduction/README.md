## Main Function Signatures
```cpp
int main()
// OR
int main(int argc, char** argv)  // argc -> no. of arguments
                                  // argv -> array of arguments (array of char*)
```

## Debugging

`Debugging` is the systematic process of finding, analyzing, and fixing errors, known as "bugs," in software or hardware to ensure it functions correctly.

It is important to know how to debug a program to be able to diagnose unwanted behaviour and fix issues easily and quickly.

During tests and especially during exams, debugging will be the best method to solve problems that occur despite initially not understanding where the issue originates from.

**Types of errors:**
1. **Compile-time errors**: Syntax errors, type mismatches
2. **Link-time errors**: Missing function definitions, library issues
3. **Runtime errors**: Crashes, incorrect behavior during execution

**Basic debugging workflow:**
1. **Reproduce the bug**: Make it happen consistently
2. **Isolate the problem**: Narrow down where it occurs
3. **Use debugging tools**: Breakpoints, variable inspection
4. **Fix and verify**: Test that the fix works

> [!NOTE]
> `debugger` = a software tool that developers use to observe, control, and fix errors in other programs. \
> \
> It allows them to pause program execution at specific points (breakpoints), examine the values of variables and memory, step through code line by line, and view the call stack to understand the program's flow

### Using the debugger
The debugger incorporates multiple tools with different uses, the most common are:
- `step over`: executes the current line of code and pauses on the next line, without entering any function calls
- `step into`: enters the code of the current line if it is/contains a function and pauses at the first line of the function
- `step out`: continues the programâ€™s execution until it exits the current function
- `continue`: resumes normal execution


**Common syntax errors:**
- Missing semicolons
- Mismatched parentheses or braces
- Misspelled keywords
- Incorrect variable declarations

### Compilation Process
&rarr; [Understanding compilation](https://www.toptal.com/c-plus-plus/c-plus-plus-understanding-compilation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/how-to-compile-a-cpp-program-using-gcc/))

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions assume the usage of `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) as the compiler, but there are many others available (g++, clang, ***Microsoft Visual C++ aka MSVC***, etc.)

Steps to compile and execute a `.cpp` file:
1. Source Code (.cpp, .h files)
2. Preprocessing
3. Compilation
4. Assembly
5. Linking
6. Execution

```bash
# ~ preprocessing ~

#   - Replaces #include <....> with actual code from the included files.
#   - Expands macros
#   n- Handles conditional compilation (#ifdef, etc.)

g++ -E main.cpp -o main.i
```

```bash
# ~ compilation ~

#   - Does Syntax checking
#   - Converts C++ to Assembly code (.s file)

g++ -S main.i -o main.s
```

```bash
# ~ assembly ~
g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o
```

```bash
# ~ linking ~

#   - Connects the main() function in main.o to add() in math_utils.o
#   - Resolves symbols from the standard library

g++ main.o math_utils.o -o main
```

```bash
# ~ execution ~
./main.exe
```

> [!NOTE]
> The usual steps required to obtain an executable is: \
> `assembly` > `linking` > `execution`

**C++11 specific compilation:**
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o program source.cpp
```

## Types

C++ provides several primitive (built-in) data types for storing different kinds of values.

### Integer Types
| Type | Size (bytes) | Range | Description |
|------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| `char` | 1 | -128 to 127 | Single character or small integer |
| `short` | 2 | -32,768 to 32,767 | Short integer |
| `int` | 4 | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | Standard integer |
| `long` | 4/8 | Platform dependent | Long integer |
| `long long` | 8 | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | Very long integer |

### Floating-Point Types
| Type | Size (bytes) | Precision | Description |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `float` | 4 | ~7 decimal digits | Single-precision floating-point |
| `double` | 8 | ~15 decimal digits | Double-precision floating-point |
| `long double` | 8/12/16 | Platform dependent | Extended precision floating-point |

### Other Types
| Type | Size (bytes) | Values | Description |
|------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| `bool` | 1 | `true` or `false` | Boolean value |
| `void` | - | No value | Represents absence of type |

### Signed vs Unsigned

**Signed types** can store both positive and negative values:
- Use one bit for the sign (positive/negative)
- Example: `int` ranges from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

**Unsigned types** can only store non-negative values:
- Use all bits for the magnitude
- Double the positive range compared to signed
- Example: `unsigned int` ranges from 0 to 4,294,967,295

```cpp
int signed_num = -100;        // Can be negative
unsigned int unsigned_num = 100; // Cannot be negative (0 or positive only)
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `unsigned` when you know the value will never be negative (like array indices, counts, etc.)

## Variables & Storage

### Global Variables

**Global variables** are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

```cpp
int global_counter = 0;  // Global variable

int main() {
    global_counter = 10;  // Can access from main
    return 0;
}

void some_function() {
    global_counter++;     // Can access from any function
}
```

**Characteristics:**
- Accessible from any function in the program
- Stored in static memory (not on the stack)
- Initialized to zero by default if not explicitly initialized
- Exist for the entire program duration

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid excessive use of global variables as they can make code harder to debug and maintain

### Static Variables

**Static variables** have different behavior depending on where they're declared:

**1. Local Static Variables (inside functions):**
```cpp
void counter_function() {
    static int count = 0;  // Local static - initialized only once
    count++;
    cout << "Called " << count << " times" << endl;
}

int main() {
    counter_function();  // Output: Called 1 times
    counter_function();  // Output: Called 2 times
    counter_function();  // Output: Called 3 times
    return 0;
}
```

**2. Global Static Variables (outside functions):**
```cpp
static int file_counter = 0;  // Global static - only accessible in this file

void increment_counter() {
    file_counter++;  // Can access from any function in this file
}

int main() {
    increment_counter();
    cout << file_counter << endl;  // Output: 1
    return 0;
}
```

**Key differences:**
- **Local static**: Retains value between calls, but only accessible within that function
- **Global static**: Accessible throughout the file, but hidden from other source files

### Const Variables

**Const variables** are immutable - their value cannot be changed after initialization.

```cpp
const int MAX_SIZE = 100;        // Must be initialized
const double PI = 3.14159;

int main() {
    // MAX_SIZE = 200;  // ERROR: Cannot modify const variable
    
    const int user_input = 50;   // Runtime initialization allowed
    return 0;
}
```

**Benefits of const:**
- Prevents accidental modification
- Makes code more readable and self-documenting
- Compiler optimizations
- Can catch errors at compile-time

```cpp
void process_data(const int& data) {  // Parameter cannot be modified
    // data = 100;  // ERROR: Cannot modify const parameter
}
```
